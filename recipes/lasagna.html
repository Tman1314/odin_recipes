            <p>This no-bake skillet lasagna is made right on your stovetop and is a fast and easy alternative to store-bought hamburger mixes!</p>
            <p>This lasagna is super easy to make and can be a quick easy meal. It was made by my great grandmother's uncle's cousin who fought in the war. He brought his recipe from a small village in the heart of the battle that was famously lost in the war. He lost both legs, one arm and seven fingers, but brought this recipe over and made it every night for all his family.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After passing this recipe down for 60 generations this recipe is finally available for you and your family to enjoy just like they did in the county it came from. Enjoy every delicious ingredient like you never have before. Once you try this recipe you'll never by store-bought again.</p>

                <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 glove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons dried basil (optional)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano (optional</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

                <li>2 cups dried malfada noodles</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
                <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
                <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
